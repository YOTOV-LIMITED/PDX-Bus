      <p>PDX Bus is an award winning application that displays arrival times for public transport in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>(PDX Bus won Best in Show at the <a href="http://www.CivicApps.org">CivicApps.org</a> awards)</p>

<p>This little application uses the Internet to quickly access TriMet's live tracking data to display arrival times perfectly formatted for the iPhone. It allows you to bookmark frequently used stops, displays recently accessed stops, and gives details for arrivals which are en-route.</p>

<p>You can enter the stop "id" of the stop (as displayed at each stop or station) or you can browse the routes for the stop.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interactive rail maps, showing the MAX, WES and Streetcar stops.</li>
<li>Embedded maps, showing locations of stops, and when available, the last known position of the bus or train.</li>
<li>Use GPS to locate nearby stops or rail stations.</li>
<li>Browse routes and stops, show an entire route on the map.</li>
<li>Links to TriMet route information.</li>
<li>Displays Rider Alerts, and Detours.</li>
<li>A "Nighttime visibility flasher" - a flashing screen that can be used at night so that drivers can see you. TriMet suggests holding up a cell phone to make yourself visible to bus drivers.</li>
<li>Trip Planning - now you can use the same trip planning feature that is available on TriMet's web site.</li>
<li>Specially formatted text to work with the iPhone 3GS VoiceOver accessibility feature to speak arrivals.</li>
</ul>

<a id="pdx-bus-81-sources" class="anchor" href="#pdx-bus-81-sources" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PDX Bus 8.1 sources</h1>

<p>I am making the sources to PDX Bus version 7.9 available as part of the
<a href="http://www.civicapps.org">Civic Apps</a> competition.  These
sources were developed by me from Apple samples and documentation, except 
where explicitly mentioned in the code.  </p>

<p>I am choosing to release a copy of the code under the 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL 2.0</a> License but I retain the copyright,
which enables me to release the iPhone app under the regular Apple iPhone 
license (this avoids any conflict of licenses for the time being).
 (No outside MPL or GPL code has been incorporated into the
code, some BSD License has been included, it is clearly marked).<br>
However - this really is the exact same code that was used to build the app, and 
I will continue to release the code for all future releases (the method of 
release may change).</p>

<p>I regret that I probably do not have the time to answer general support 
questions about iPhone application development - all you need to know can be 
found at <a href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a>
(You need a Mac to develop for the iPhone, you will also need to purchase a 
$100 membership to get a certificate to put an application on
an actual device).</p>

<p>Because I wish to retain the sole copyright on the code, I am currently not
yet collaborating on development - but this may change as I work out
how open source iPhone development can work.</p>

<p>Of course this code can be used as a reference 
and in other code, but be sure to comply with the license! This code was 
written initially as a fun learning project for me to learn Objective-C, and 
has grown from there.  There may be better, more efficient, cleaner, more 
elegent or more correct ways to do all of it, but this is what I came up with 
in my spare time, and it gets the job done.  I am working on tidying it up 
to enable it to be of more use.</p>

<ul>
<li>PDX Bus is built with iPhone SDK 9.2 and Xcode 7.2 - available free
from <a href="http://developer.apple.com">Apple</a> in their Mac App store.</li>
<li>Before building this code you will need to register with TriMet 
to get a free "AppID" from <a href="http://developer.trimet.org/registration/">TriMet</a>,
this is so that TriMet can track who is using their API. The AppID is 
placed in TriMetTypes.h as the #define TRIMET_APP_ID.  Without this id 
the application will not work, the code will not compile until this is 
addressed.</li>
<li>For licensing reasons, some graphics are not included with this source 
(see below).</li>
<li>Other graphics are included under Creative Commons Licenses - please check the
folders for the particular licenses used.</li>
<li>The data feed from <a href="http://www.civicapps.org/datasets/portland-streetcar-routes-arrivals">Next Bus</a> 
has terms and conditions (including a non-commercial clause) but does 
not need an application ID.</li>
<li>This builds with one warning - "All interface orientations must be supported 
unless the app requires full screen". This is because on the iPhone we don't 
want the app to go into landscape mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="graphics" class="anchor" href="#graphics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Graphics</h2>

<p>This source distribution builds and runs, but the project will not attempt 
to copy any missing graphics files into the application package.<br>
If you download the graphics from the sources below, you must enable 
the project to copy them into the application. </p>

<h3>
<a id="trimet-graphics" class="anchor" href="#trimet-graphics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TriMet Graphics</h3>

<p>Two graphics files were provided to me by permission of TriMet, and should 
be placed in the TriMet folder and then assigned to the target in the Xcode 
project (see below).
PDX Bus will work without them, except the Rail Map will not be displayed.</p>

<ul>
<li>The visittrimeticon.gif file is available from the TriMet page about 
<a href="http://www.trimet.org/help/linking.htm">linking</a>
</li>
<li>The map of the rail system, railsystem.gif, is a 2000x765 gif file made 
from the PDF of the rail map.<br>
(The size here is important for the positioning of the hotspots). The original 
file is available here -
<a href="http://www.trimet.org/maps/railsystem.htm">http://www.trimet.org/maps/railsystem.htm</a> - I was granted special permission to use it for PDX Bus with a disclaimer - 
you will need to ask permission if you want to distribute it
in some way.  Note that I took the PDF and made the GIF file - the GIF 
file provided by TriMet is too small
and will not work.  This gif file is converted into a set of tiles to enable a more efficient display.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the graphics have been downloaded and copied into place you will need to 
enable them in the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Xcode project, under Resouces you will find graphics folders. The file names
will be red for any missing files.</li>
<li>For files that are not red, select them all, CTRL-Click then 
choose "Get Info" from the pop-up menu.</li>
<li>On the Info dialog box, click on the Targets tab, and select
